# Hand-Guided Teleoperation for SO-ARM100

Real-time teleoperation of the [SO-ARM100](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100) robotic arm using hand tracking and depth sensing. Point with your index finger in front of a depth camera and the robot follows.

Built on ROS 2 Jazzy, MediaPipe, and [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot).

## How It Works

A RealSense depth camera captures RGB and depth streams. MediaPipe detects the index fingertip in the RGB frame and publishes its pixel coordinates. Those pixels are back-projected into 3D using the depth image and camera intrinsics. An AprilTag fixed to the robot base provides the camera-to-robot transform via TF2, so the 3D point is converted into the robot's coordinate frame. Finally, an IK solver (from LeRobot) computes joint angles and sends them to the arm over serial.

## Packages

| Package | Node | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `hand_tracking` | `hand_tracker` | Detects index fingertip via MediaPipe, publishes `/hand_pixel` |
| `teleop_mapper` | `pixel_to_3d` | Back-projects pixel + depth into a 3D point, publishes `/hand_3d` |
| `point_target` | `transform_point` | Transforms `/hand_3d` from camera frame to `base_link` via TF2, publishes `/target_point` |
| `system_bringup` | `tag_to_tf` | Listens to AprilTag detections, broadcasts the camera→base_link TF |
| `arm_control` | — | Placeholder for future arm control nodes |
| `robot_description` | — | URDF, Xacro, and RViz display launch files for the SO101 |

## Topics

| Topic | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/camera/side_camera/color/image_raw` | `sensor_msgs/Image` | RGB image from RealSense |
| `/camera/side_camera/depth/image_rect_raw` | `sensor_msgs/Image` | Aligned depth image |
| `/camera/side_camera/color/camera_info` | `sensor_msgs/CameraInfo` | Camera intrinsics |
| `/hand_pixel` | `geometry_msgs/PointStamped` | Fingertip pixel coordinates |
| `/hand_3d` | `geometry_msgs/PointStamped` | Fingertip in 3D (camera frame) |
| `/target_point` | `geometry_msgs/PointStamped` | Fingertip in 3D (robot frame) |
| `/detections` | `apriltag_msgs/AprilTagDetectionArray` | AprilTag detections |

## Requirements

### Hardware

- Lerobot arm (SO101 variant)
- Intel RealSense depth camera

### Software

- Ubuntu 24.04
- ROS 2 Jazzy
- Python 3.12
- [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) (for kinematics and motor control)
- [realsense2_camera](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros) ROS 2 driver

## Setup

### 1. Build the workspace

```bash
cd hand_based_manipulation
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python
```

### 3. Set up LeRobot (in a separate conda env)

Follow the installation instructions at https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/installation, then run:

```bash
conda activate lerobot
```

### 4. URDF (for Kinematics)

The SO101 URDF (`so101_new_calib.urdf`) ships with the `robot_description` package under `src/robot_description/urdf/`. To visualize it in RViz:

```bash
ros2 launch robot_description so101_display.launch.py
```

## Running


### Full system launch

This starts the RealSense camera, AprilTag detector, tag-to-TF bridge, hand tracker, Pixel-to-3D conversion and Camera-to-robot frame transform which give the target position 


```bash
ros2 launch system_bringup full_system.launch.py
```


Then in a separate terminal:

```bash



# Robot controller (requires LeRobot conda env)
conda activate lerobot
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
python hand_chase.py
```

## Safety

- Motor velocity and acceleration are capped on startup for safe testing.
- Target positions are clamped to a bounded workspace before IK is solved.
- The robot moves to home position when no target point are received and on `Ctrl+C`.
